# Description:
- Create a class to simulate basic functionality of a smart phone.  
- The owner ‘pretends’ to do basic tasks like send texts, stream audio (e.g. Pandora) and print a monthly statement.  
- The basic phone plan includes unlimited voice, unlimited texts and 2 gigabytes of data (2 GB) for a base fee of $50. 
- An additional data fee of $15 is charged for each partial GB used above the 2.0 GB provided in the basic plan. 
- The phone uses data for audio streaming at the rate of 65 MB per hour.  (Note that 1 GB equals one thousand megabytes, i.e. 1,000 MB).  
- A fully charged battery will last for twelve hours of audio.  Texting does not consume battery life.
