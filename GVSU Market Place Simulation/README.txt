DESCRIPTION
Create an application to simulate customers arriving and departing the GVSU Market Place on a busy football Saturday.  
The store manager will use the simulation to predict how long customers will be waiting in line and how many cashiers to schedule.   
Customers enter the store, browse for items, and then some customers get in line with their purchases.

After shopping, customers get in a single line and wait for their turn at one of the cashiers.  
Customers eventually move to the next available cashier.  
After the customer pays for her purchases, she leaves and the next customer in line (if any) moves to the cashier.  
This continues all day long until closing time.  
At closing, the customers in line will stay but no new customers can get in line. 
The store opens at 10:00 am and closes at 6:00 pm.
