Description for U.S. Baby Names
The U.S. Social Security Administration has a database that contains all births since 1880.  
This database has over one million records.  
Each record contains a name, gender, number of births with that name and a year.
We simplified and cleaned up the data.  
We also removed all records with fewer than 100 births in a year but there are still over 200,000 records.
